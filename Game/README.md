# The 'Echoes Behind Closed Doors' Game 

for the Immersive Technology Development module as part of the Year 2.2
Integrated Project for Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Diploma in Immersive Media

### Gameplay
The game follows a teen that is a victim of Domestic Abuse which also leads to
substance abuse. Players experience life in their shoes and throughout will discover
hints of their struggles. They slowly stop going to school due to their worsening 
condition. Eventually, a friend calls after noticing their absence, leading to 2 choices:
- Seek Help: The protagonist opens up, and the screen fades, leaving the ending open for interpretation.
- Continue Spiraling: The protagonist ignores the call, and the loop restarts with subtle changes, 
  reflecting their deteriorating mental state.
